Selecting the right domain adaptation model
===========================================

When facing a new domain adaptation problem, it can be particularly difficult to choose the appropriate transfer learning algorithm.

The flowchart below has been designed to help the user to quickly identify which type of algorithm
could be used in a specific case. The choice of transfer method is driven by practical characteristics 
derived from the available datasets.
